## 01 Revving Up Bootstrap 

* Carousel本意为旋转木马或幻灯片传送圆盘
* Jumbotron本意为大屏幕
> **Warning** It should be noted that carousels are becoming an increasingly unpopular design choice

*  Twitter's Bootstrap于2011年第一次发布
*  Bootstrap 4从头开始重写，而不是基于之前版本的简单重构。Bootstrap 4停止了对旧版本浏览器的支持. It is important to note that unlike its predecessor, Bootstrap 4 no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions.
*  With Bootstrap 4, grid system has been completely overhauled, and a new grid tier has been added。 Also, Bootstrap 4 now ships with default support for a CSS3 layout mode called flexbox
*  The Bootstrap 4 card component replaces the existing wells, thumbnails, and panels
*  Bootstrap's mobile-first design philosophy implies that its components must display and function correctly at the smallest screen size possible.  Bootstrap promotes a bottom-up approach, forcing developers to get the user interface to render correctly on the smallest possible screen size, before expanding upward.
*  Less is the official Bootstrap 3 build, while Bootstrap 4 has been developed from scratch, and is written entirely in Sass
*  Unlike its predecessor, Bootstrap 4 no longer uses pixel (px) as its unit of typographic measurement. Instead, it primarily uses root em (rem). The recently introduced rem measurement aims to address both em's and px's shortcomings by combining their two strengths; instead of being relative to a parent element, rem is relative to the page's root element
*  Bootstrap requires another third-party library **Popper**, for displaying popovers and tooltips
